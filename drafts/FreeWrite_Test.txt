Hi. Welcome to Freewrite :)
Plz read this guide.

I beg of you.

It's 5 min max.

My name is Farza.

I made this app.

This is not a journaling app or a note-taking app.
If you use it for that, you'll probably use it once or twice,
and then never touch it again.

This is a tool purely to help you freewrite.

Freewriting is a writing strategy developed in 1973 â€” it's where you write
continuously for a set time without worrying about grammar, spelling, or anything 
like that. A pure stream of consciousness.
                    
This is a Python Rewrite of the original Freewrite app, which was made in Native Swift.
Now this Application is cross-platform and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
This is a fork of Farza's original Freewrite app!
